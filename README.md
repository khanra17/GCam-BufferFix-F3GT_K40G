# GCam BufferFix (F3GT/K40G)
This Magisk module fixes the viewfinder lag issue in Google Camera (GCam) for the POCO F3 GT and Redmi K40 Gaming devices. The module replaces the libmtkcam_featurepolicy.so HAL with a patched version, which resolves the viewfinder lag problem.

The module can detect the firmware version of your device automatically and flash the appropriate patched HAL accordingly. It currently supports firmware versions 12.x.x and 14.x.x.

### Usage
Install this module via Magisk Manager or by flashing the provided [ZIP file](https://github.com/khanra17/GCam-BufferFix-F3GT_K40G/releases) in recovery mode.
